# SmallNFT.com --- Elite Mega-Site Blueprint (README)

## The Global Discovery Engine for Emerging & Independent NFT Culture

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Executive Vision

**SmallNFT.com** is not a marketplace clone.\
It is not a hype tracker.\
It is not a "cheap NFT" directory.

It is a category-defining discovery platform built around one powerful
idea:

> Small = Early. Independent. Scarce. Intimate. Emerging.

SmallNFT.com becomes the structured home for:

-   Micro-collections\
-   Independent creators\
-   Niche communities\
-   Experimental drops\
-   Early-stage digital culture\
-   Low-supply ecosystems\
-   Undervalued creative projects

This is the seed layer of NFT culture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
